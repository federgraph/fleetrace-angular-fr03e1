<ul>
    <li>A Typescript / Angular app.</li>
    <li>You can input timing data and compute results locally.</li>
    <li>Since you own the data you could get a license, host the app on your site, and serve results to at least all the entries in a race.</li>
</ul>

<p>FREO is the event only version.</p>

<h4>Getting Started</h4>

<p>I recommend that you try out the following steps, it should work:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Click Reset button, it will load the default test event and show the event table below the input area.</li>
    <li>The test event has two races.</li>
    <li>Navigate through the races with R- and R+ buttons.</li>
    <li>Click Next button, it will take you to Race 1.</li>
    <li>Because button Next has figured out where we are in the progress of the event - the first race.</li>
    <li>Notice how the current race is displayed as part of the input header line.</li>
    <li>Click on the circular fab buttons (floating action buttons).</li>
    <li>At least once: select the dnf radio button before you click.</li>
    <li>Notice how the radio selection will jump back to finish when you click a fab.</li>
    <li>The fab just clicked will turn blue.</li>
    <li>Click Next again when all fabs have been used.</li>
    <li>You will be advanced to the next race, please check.</li>
    <li>Continue with the fabs.</li>
    <li>Play with the toolbar icon buttons, most of them have the Reduce To action type.</li>
    <li>Some of the buttons will toggle, some will show, hide, or have an action type of Reduce To.</li>
    <li>Go ahead and input finish positions for Race 2.</li>
    <li>There are only two races in this test event.</li>
    <li>When done, examine that series scoring is correct in table event.</li>
    <li>Adjust the number of throwouts with button T+ and T-.</li>
    <li>Note that you can sort the html table with a click on the column header.</li>
    <li>Find the Pre-Text area and use it to copy result data in compact format to the clipboard.</li>
    <li>Try and paste the text data you just copied into your favorite code editor program.</li>
    <li>I assume that you test in Chrome on the desktop before you use it on a tablet or even a phone.</li>
</ol>

<p>You need to input a finish position or a status value for all the entries in a race.</p>

<ul>
    <li>A regatta has events.</li>
    <li>An event is sometimes called a division.</li>
    <li>An event has races and entries, columns and rows.</li>
    <li>The entries in a race are called bibs, corresponding to bows or bow numbers.</li>
    <li>By tapping on fabs you finish off bibs until done.</li>
    <li>You can assign a status value like dnf to a bib instead of a finish position.</li>
    <li>You can also erase the time for the current bib or reset the status to ok.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some magic will be used, called strict input mode.</p>

<ul>
    <li>When you click a fab - a message is generated with a finish higher than the numbers of entries in the race.</li>
    <li>In strict input mode the program automatically maintains a contiguous range of finish positions.</li>
    <li>You do not have to worry about the actual position.</li>
    <li>The entry will receive the next free position.</li>
    <li>Just tap on a fab, the rest is automatic.</li>
    <li>Note that when an event is loaded, it is done in relaxed input mode, and actual finish positions will be used.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the desktop with only eight entries in the race, everything seems to be fast and snappy.</p>

<ul>
    <li>You can watch both tables while you are finishing off bibs.</li>
    <li>You can afford to compute the whole event after each message.</li>
    <li>But the phone cannot show big tables.</li>
    <li>Small devices may be slow if everything is computed and displayed after each input message.</li>
    <li>They will be slow if the number of entries in the event is big.</li>
    <li>This is when you should use the message queue.</li>
    <li>Use of the queue is toggled with the paper clip icon button.</li>
    <li>When the queue is active you see two additional icons.</li>
    <li>When using the queue, you need to manually trigger the processing of recorded messages.</li>
    <li>Just click on the button that has the blue badge for the number of items in the queue.</li>
    <li>You can discard the content of the queue and / or show the content of the queue in Pre-Text.</li>
</ul>

<p>Change data, make corrections for a bib in a race.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Select the bib first!</li>
    <li>The bib from last used fab is already selected as current bib.</li>
    <li>But you can make any of the bibs current with Bib- and Bib+</li>
    <li>Pay attention to the radio buttons, select erase or ok to clear position or status.</li>
    <li>Then the blue toy button will do the trick.</li>
    <li>Note that you can do private what-if analysis in downloaded event data.</li>
    <li>For example: What-if I had not been disqualified.</li>
</ul>

<p>What if there are problems, mistakes, special situations?</p>

<ul>
    <li>What if I need to enter a percent penalty or a dpi penalty?</li>
    <li>What if you need to correct a finish position?</li>
    <li>You can edit the text data of the event and reload.</li>
    <li>Use the Text-Area html element to do this.</li>
    <li>Learn from the provided examples.</li>
    <li>The examples will show you what the message format looks like.</li>
    <li>To correct a finish position, add a race value message after switching to strict input mode.</li>
    <li>Then press the read button.</li>
</ul>

<pre>
    //in the text area html element
    //event data, loaded in relaxed input mode
    //relaxed input mode is implicit when reading data
    //...

    EP.IM = Strict
    FR.*.W2.Bib2.RV=4
</pre>

<p>Copy the finish positions from the black board after the fact.</p>

<ul>
    <li>This is a great use case.</li>
    <li>You form a team of two.</li>
    <li>One will read the finish list.</li>
    <li>The other will tap on the fabs.</li>
    <li>At first race: Create a new event with the appropriate start list count and race count.</li>
    <li>Don’t forget to Save to local storage.</li>
    <li>The next day, press Load before you continue with the next race.</li>
</ul>

<p>We take it easy with athlete names in this app.</p>

<ul>
    <li>When race timing starts, entry registration has already finished.</li>
    <li>When you do race timing you do not care about athlete names.</li>
    <li>Entry info should be inserted into the prepared event data text you start out from.</li>
    <li>My test data does not include athlete’s names anyways.</li>
    <li>And the entries table most often will be empty.</li>
    <li>In the light version I have removed all UI for Entries.</li>
</ul>

<p>Start with the recording of finish positions.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Let’s hope that <em>they</em> have provided for consecutive bow numbers starting at 1.</li>
    <li>For learning about the data format, have a look at normal and compact text output in the Pre-Text area.</li>
    <li>You can bring up the Pre-Text area or Text-Area area with an icon button.</li>
    <li>Please test on the desktop browser where you have a good keyboard and where it is convenient to use the clipboard.</li>
</ul>
